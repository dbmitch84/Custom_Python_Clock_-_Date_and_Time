  Custom Python Clock - Date and Time
</h1>

### This Repository's Purpose
This is a little project that I decided to try to do.  It lets you create a custom digital clock to keep somewhere on your screen with the date and time. Unlike other similar projects designed to help you learn Python, this one gives you the ability to change the background to whatever you want.<br />
After trying one or two of the other projects, I decided to that I wanted to have a fun background on my clock so it wasn’t so boring. The hard part was trying to figure out how to have the background without the text’s frames blocking it (similar to the annoying white box you get when you add pictures to something). The final part was figuring out how to get the whole thing to run as an executable file with the picture in it. I was eventually able to figure out how to do just that thanks to auto-py-to-exe. That’ll be a separate posting.<br />
One final thing that separates this from other projects is the fact that it was all created and done using programs off of a thumbdrive. This was done in part to show that you can make things from almost anywhere, even without having administrator priviliges on the computer!<br />
